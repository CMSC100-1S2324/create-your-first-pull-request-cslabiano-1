I am expecting that this course would be challenging based on the stories told by the upperclassmen.
This will be my first encounter with the topics within this course, so I am hoping to learn a lot and have fun while doing so.
My expectations from the faculty-in-charge is that they will be able to deliver the information and knowledge that we will be needing.
